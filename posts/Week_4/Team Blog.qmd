# Week Four for the Housing Team

This blog outlines where the Housing Team is at after week four of DSPG. We have made a lot of progress in the past four weeks, and we are excited to share it with you!

## Project Overview

![](Week%20Four%20Team%20Blog%20Images/Project%20Outline.png){fig-align="center"}

## Problem Statement

[huh I can't find the document that had the description of our project in it.]{.underline}

## Goals and Objectives

-   Generate Google Street View urls for Slater, Independence, Grundy Center, and New Hampton

-   Scrape available housing data for Slater, Independence, Grundy Center, and New Hampton

    -   Zillow

    -   Realtors.com

    -   Beacon

    -   Vanguard

-   Create an AI model

[what]{.underline} [else do we have for goals and objectives]{.underline}

## Our Progress

We have been making good progress to complete the goals and objectives we outlined above. Since the beginning of the Data Science for the Public Good Program, we have been expanding our knowledge of data science, particularly in areas that relate to this housing project. We have been learning and covering new concepts through DataCamp. We have also watched two webinars on TidyCensus training, as well as started creating AI Models to practice with.

### Data Camp Training:

-   GitHub Concepts

-   AI Fundamentals

-   Introduction to R

-   Intermediate R

-   Introduction to the Tidyverse

-   Web Scraping in R

-   Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras

### TidyCensus Demographic Data Collection:

One of the first steps in our project was to explore the available demographic data in our selected cities and counties. We thought it valuable to understand the demographic data, and we have represented in the plots below:

### Creating AI Models:

The next step was creating an AI Model. We decided to create an AI Model early in the project before finishing the housing data collection so that we had a better understanding when it came to putting everything together. The AI Model below tests for vegetation in front of houses.

### This week:

#### In-Person Data Collection

On Tuesday this week, the entire DSPG program went to Slater to practice data collection in person. The housing group took this as an opportunity to collect some housing photos on the ground to use in our AI Model later on.

[Do we have photos to use here?]{.underline}

#### Google Street View and URLs

We are getting the majority of our photos for the AI to use from Google Street View. Google has an API key that you can use to generate an image for a specific address. We spent the first half of this week pulling addresses from each of our cities and creating URLs to pull the images from Google Street View.

We ran into a couple of problems when doing this, the biggest of which is displayed in the images below. Because we are working with cities in rural areas, there is not Google Street View images available for every street in our cities.

![Google Street View information for New Hampton, Iowa. For reference, population was 3,368 as of 2023.](Week%20Four%20Team%20Blog%20Images/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(4).png){fig-align="center" width="584"}

[Do we have more photos to use here?]{.underline}

#### Web Scraping

Once we were finished collecting addresses and generating URLs, we moved on to scraping the web for more images. We decided to grab images from Zillow, Realtors.com, and the county assessor pages for our cities. We were able to successfully scrape images from Zillow this week.

[insert images of web scraping progress after today]{.underline}
